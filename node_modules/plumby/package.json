As express, its clean and nice API provides a robust set of features to build scalable and maintainable application in a flash.\n\n## Installation\n\n  Install with [npm](http://nodejs.org):\n\n    $ npm install plumby\n\n  Install with [component](http://component.io):\n\n    $ component install bredele/plumby\n\nSee [Documentation](https://github.com/bredele/plumby/wiki).\n\n## Philosophy\n\n  The Plumby philosophy is to reduce the complexity of your web application by splitting it into small and **self contained** modules (or apps). An app is highly extensible, configurable and communicates through event messages. \n\n  > Plumby is inspired by [Addy Osmany](http://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/) and [Nicholas Zakas](http://www.slideshare.net/nzakas/scalable-javascript-application-architecture-2012) work.\n\n  Its consistent interface makes developping a web application **as easy as playing to legos**. You can add, assemble or remove some apps, your application will never break. Most important, you can **[reuse](#ecosystem)** your apps in different projects and save some precious time!\n\n  For example, a web application like Gmail would look like:\n\n```js\nvar plumby = require('plumby');\n\nplumby()\n  .use(auth())\n  .use(mail())\n  .use(spam())\n  .use(chat()); //reused in google hangout\n```\n\n## Ecosystem\n\n  Plumby is also an ecosystem of plugins and apps. You can use apps to authenticate your apps, connect to an external service like Facebook or Twitter, store your data and way more in a single line of code. \n\n  See [wiki](https://github.com/bredele/plumby/wiki) for list of third plugins and apps.\n\n  Because Plumby makes easy to expose and reuse third apps, you won't have to reinvent the wheel or do the same stuff all over again. Instead you'll be able to focus on what makes your application special.\n\n## Features and Benefits\n\nFeatures:\n\n  - Event communication bus\n  - Observable data store\n  - Elegant dependencies injector\n  - Lifecycle hooks\n  - DOM and library agnostic\n  - High test coverage\n  - Support all mainstream browsers\n\nAt the opposite of many web framework, Plumby doesn't make the assumption an app is related to DOM. For example, an app can just process data from a server and be used in a worker.\nIt does not force you to use any libray or template engine. You are free to use whatever you want and to write the code you like. \n\nActually, an app could use a view plugin piped to the app hooks and events. It makes a flexible and powerful solution to create user interfaces.\n\n```js\nvar ui = plumby()\n\nui.use(view('hello', '#hello'));\nui.use(view('world', '#world'));\n```\n\nBenefits:\n\n  - Loose coupling\n  - Configurable\n  - Highly extensible\n  - hybrid (server side)\n  - maintainable\n  - reusable\n  - scalable\n\n## Browser Support\n\nStore supports all mainstream browsers from IE8+.\n\n## License\n\n  The MIT License (MIT)\n\n  Copyright (c) 2014 <Olivier Wietrich> Olivier Wietrich\n\n  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n  of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n  in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n  to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n  copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n  furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n  all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
